# Student-Enrollment-Data-Warehouse

Problem Statement:

There has been tremendous growth in the education structure at Syracuse University because of the fact that they provide classes on campus, distance learning programs and online classes. Hence a need arises for the assessment for course catalog. This assessment requires the university to conduct a trend analysis for the enrolment activity for the courses. This trend analysis involves the number of enrolments for courses and the number of students that drop the class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background:

Students can drop classes due to many factors that can range from being obvious reasons to unknown/indeterminable reasons. The factors can be like manual errors, opting for substitute classes, time clashes, course-work, reputation of the faculty. Also students drop classes if get a chance to join the same course under a different faculty who is a generous grader.

Project Objective:

The objective of our project is to have a rough idea of the trends for enrolment activity and provide a count of the number of enrollments and drops for a course to the University Staff. The end-product of this project is to provide valuable information to the University in order to make a business decision to improve course services, course technology, course modification, or even creating or developing a new course according to the industry requirement, dropping courses from the catalog or continuing with the same course offerings based on the assessment of the course catalog.
